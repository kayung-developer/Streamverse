STREAMVERSE - ULTIMATE VIDEO STREAMING (INTELLIGENT EDITION V2.1)

ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
This is a program called Streamverse. It's version 2.1, the Intelligent Edition. It's supposed to be an ultimate video streaming platform. You can watch videos, create user accounts, have different profiles for different people, and it even has some smart features (though many are just for show in this version). It's all built into one single HTML file that uses React and a JavaScript SQL database to work right in your web browser. It tries to look nice with themes and stuff, but it's mainly a demonstration of various web application features.

HOW TO RUN IT:
1.  Save all the code provided into a single file named `streamverse.html` (or any other `.html` name).
2.  Make sure you have the `sql-wasm.wasm` file from `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/sql.js/1.10.3/sql-wasm.wasm`. The code tries to load this from a CDN (Content Delivery Network), so as long as you are connected to the internet when you open the HTML file, it should download it automatically. If you want to run this completely offline, you would need to download this `sql-wasm.wasm` file and place it in the same folder as your `streamverse.html` file, and then you might need to adjust the path in the HTML code where it looks for this file, but for most users, just opening the HTML file in a browser while online is enough.
3.  Open the `streamverse.html` file in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Double-click it or use your browser's "File > Open" menu.
4.  The application will start. It might show a loading screen for a few seconds while it sets everything up.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
-   HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
-   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
-   JavaScript (ECMAScript programming language)
-   React.js (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, loaded from a CDN)
-   Babel (a JavaScript compiler, used here to make JSX (React's HTML-like syntax) work in the browser, loaded from a CDN)
-   SQL.js (this lets the program use an SQLite database directly in the web browser using WebAssembly, loaded from a CDN)
-   Font Awesome (for icons like play buttons, hearts, etc., loaded from a CDN)
-   Google Fonts (for the text styles and fonts used in the app, loaded from a CDN)

MAIN THINGS IT DOES:
This program lets you do a lot of things, like: watch different sample videos such as Big Buck Bunny and Sintel. It has a main page with a big hero video at the top and then rows of other videos sorted by different categories like "Animation", "Action", or "Recommended For You". You can click on a video to go to a player page. The player page shows the video itself, its description, who uploaded it, ratings, how many views it has, and other details. You can play, pause, and control the video volume and fullscreen. It remembers how much of a video you watched for your current profile, so if you leave and come back, it might offer to resume or show a progress bar on the video card. You can add videos to your favorites list if you like them. You can also like or dislike videos using thumbs up/down buttons. There's a section for comments below the video player where users (if logged in) can write things about the video, and it shows who wrote what and when they wrote it. The system supports user registration where you can create an account with a username, email address, and a password. After logging in, you can create multiple user profiles (up to 5 profiles per account are allowed), similar to how services like Netflix let you have different profiles for different people in your household. Each profile can have its own avatar (picture), name, and can be marked as a child profile which affects what kind of content they are allowed to see based on parental control settings that can be configured. The parental control system uses standard content ratings like G (General Audiences), PG (Parental Guidance Suggested), PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), and so on, up to NC-17. You can search for videos by typing a word or phrase in a search box located in the navigation bar at the top of the page. The search results then show up on a separate page, listing all videos that match your search term in their title, description, genre, or tags. There are also separate pages specifically for "TV Shows" and "Movies" and a placeholder page for "Live" content, which basically filter the videos to show only those types. The application has a settings page where you can manage your main user account details, and more importantly, manage all your profiles. For each profile, you can edit its name, avatar URL, whether it's a child profile or not, and the specific parental control rating limit. You can also change individual profile settings like whether videos should automatically play the next one in a series (autoplay), what the default video quality should be (this is mostly simulated as the sample videos have fixed quality), and a preferred audio language (also simulated). You can also manage notification preferences on this settings page, such as whether you want to get alerts for new episodes of shows you watch, or personalized recommendations, or reminders for live events. You can also set an email address where these notifications would theoretically be sent. The whole application can switch between a dark theme (dark backgrounds, light text) and a light theme (light backgrounds, dark text), and this theme preference can be saved per profile, so different profiles can have different themes. There's a subscription system with three tiers: Basic (which is free), Premium, and Professional. These tiers offer different (simulated) features like access to more content, better streaming quality (e.g., HD or 4K, though this is just for show with the sample videos), and a different number of concurrent streams allowed (also simulated). You can go to a subscription page to see these plans and their features and prices (which are fake). If you choose to upgrade to a paid plan, a payment modal (pop-up window) appears which simulates paying with a credit card or Google Pay. This is all for demonstration purposes and no real money is involved or charged. Your chosen subscription level is saved with your user account information. The system also has an in-app notification feature that can pop up small messages at the bottom right of the screen for things like new recommendations, or to confirm that your settings were saved, or that a subscription was "processed". The database for all user information, video details, watch history, favorites, comments, reactions, profiles, and subscriptions is stored in your web browser's local storage using the SQL.js (SQLite) system. The navigation bar at the top also changes its appearance slightly (gets a shadow) if you scroll down the page. The footer at the bottom of the page has copyright information. There's a loading spinner shown when the app first starts up and initializes the database and other components. The application tries to be responsive, meaning it should adjust its layout to look okay on different screen sizes like desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, but it might not be perfectly optimized for all sizes. Many of the "Intelligent" or "AI" features mentioned in the app (like personalized recommendations, dynamic hero content, adaptive bitrate streaming, or semantic search) are just placeholders or are very simply simulated with basic logic, not real artificial intelligence.

DATABASE STUFF:
The program uses something called SQL.js. This is basically a full SQLite database system that runs completely inside your web browser, using new web technologies like WebAssembly. All your data – like your user accounts, which videos you've watched, your list of favorite videos, any comments you've made, your profile settings, and your pretend subscription status – is stored in this in-browser database. The database file itself is then saved in a part of your browser's storage called "localStorage". This is convenient because it works offline after the first load, but it also means that if you clear your browser's localStorage for this website, or if you use a different web browser, or use incognito/private browsing mode, all your Streamverse data will be gone (or won't be accessible). It's not stored on a central internet server like a real streaming service. When the app starts, it checks if there's an existing database in localStorage. If there is, it loads it. If not (like the first time you run it), it creates a new, empty database and then fills it with some sample video information so you have something to watch.

USER ACCOUNTS AND PROFILES:
To use most of the features in Streamverse, you generally need to create a user account. You can sign up by providing a username, an email address, and a password. Once you have an account, you can log in using your email (or username) and password. Each user account can then create and manage up to 5 different profiles. You can think of these profiles like how Netflix or Disney+ let different people in a family have their own "user" area. Each profile gets its own name, a picture (avatar URL you can provide), and its own specific settings. For instance, one profile can be for a child, with parental controls set to only show kid-friendly content, while another profile for an adult can access everything. Each profile also keeps its own separate watch history, favorites, and recommendations. This way, what one person watches doesn't mess up the suggestions or history for another person using the same main account. When you log in, if you have multiple profiles, you'll be asked to choose which profile you want to use for that session.

VIDEO STUFF:
You can find videos to watch on the home page, which usually shows a featured video and several rows of videos grouped by genre or other categories (like "Continue Watching" or "Recommended"). There are also specific pages for "TV Shows" and "Movies" if you only want to see those. Videos are displayed as "cards" which show a small picture (thumbnail) of the video, its title, and usually its rating. When you click on a video card, you're taken to the video player page. This page is where the actual video plays. It also shows more details about the video, like a longer description, the year it was made, its duration, genre, and more. On the player page, you can:
-   Play, pause, control the volume, and make the video fullscreen.
-   Mark the video as a favorite (or un-favorite it if it's already a favorite).
-   Give the video a "like" (thumbs up) or a "dislike" (thumbs down).
-   Read comments left by other users and, if you're logged in, write your own comments.
-   You can also search for videos from most pages using the search bar in the top navigation.
The system also tries to keep track of how much of each video you've watched (your progress). This is used for the "Continue Watching" section and to show progress bars on video cards if you've started a video but not finished it. It also gives very basic "Recommendations" based on what you've watched, but this is a very simple simulation.

MONEY STUFF (SUBSCRIPTIONS):
Streamverse includes a simulated subscription system with different plans: Basic, Premium, and Professional.
-   The Basic plan is presented as free, but might have limitations like only access to certain videos or ads (though ads aren't actually implemented in this demo).
-   The Premium and Professional plans are presented as costing (fake) money per month or per year. They supposedly give you more features, such as access to all videos in the catalog, higher streaming quality (like HD or 4K, though the sample videos are what they are), or the ability to "stream" on more devices at once (this is also just for show).
You can see details about these plans on the "Subscription" page in the app. If you click to choose a Premium or Professional plan, a payment form will appear. This form asks for (fake) credit card details or lets you (pretend to) use Google Pay. This is purely a simulation for demonstration purposes. No real payment is made, no actual credit card information is processed or stored securely (it's not stored at all beyond the simulation). It's just there to show how a subscription and payment process might look in a web application. Your chosen subscription level (Basic, Premium, or Professional) is then saved with your user account data in the local browser database.

SETTINGS AND LOOKS:
There is a "Settings" page in the application where you can customize various things. On this page, you can typically:
-   View your main user account details, like your username and registered email address.
-   Find a link to manage your subscription (which takes you to the Subscription page).
-   Manage your user profiles (if you have any). For each profile associated with your account, you can:
    -   Change the profile's name.
    -   Change the URL for the profile's avatar (picture).
    -   Set whether the profile is for a child or an adult.
    -   Adjust the parental control settings to limit the content rating (e.g., G, PG, PG-13) that can be viewed under that profile.
    -   Change playback preferences for that profile, such as whether the next episode in a series should autoplay, or what the default video quality should be (this is simulated, as actual quality depends on the source video).
    -   Change notification preferences for that profile, like if you want to receive (simulated) alerts about new episodes or recommendations.
-   Change the overall visual appearance (theme) of the application. There's usually a choice between a Dark theme (darker backgrounds) and a Light theme (lighter backgrounds). Your theme choice is typically saved for your currently active profile, so different profiles can have different preferred themes.

NOTIFICATIONS THING:
The application has a very simple built-in notification system. From time to time, small messages might appear, usually at the bottom-right corner of your screen. These are used for various purposes, such as:
-   Confirming an action, like "Settings saved successfully!"
-   Providing information, for example, in this demo, it might pop up a (simulated) "New Episode Alert!" or suggest a "Recommendation" based on very simple logic.
-   Alerting you to an error if something didn't work.
These notifications usually stay on screen for a few seconds and then disappear automatically, or you can often click a little 'x' icon on them to close them immediately. This is all handled within the app itself; they are not system notifications from your operating system or browser in the traditional sense.

IMPORTANT NOTES / DISCLAIMER:
-   This whole Streamverse application is a DEMONSTRATION. It's made to show how certain features of a web application could work. Many of these features are simplified, or just simulated, and not fully implemented like they would be in a real, commercial product.
-   Passwords are NOT stored securely in this demo. The code includes a placeholder for "hashing" but it's extremely basic and not safe for real-world use. You should absolutely NOT use any of your real passwords when testing this application.
-   All data (your account, profiles, watch history, etc.) is stored ONLY in YOUR web browser's local storage. This means if you clear your browser's cache/data for this site, or if you use a different web browser, or if you use a private/incognito browsing window, your data will be gone or inaccessible. It is NOT a real online service where data is saved on a central server.
-   The "AI" (Artificial Intelligence) and "Intelligent" features mentioned (like smart recommendations, dynamic content, etc.) are mostly just for show. They use very simple programming logic to mimic what an AI might do, but there's no actual AI running.
-   The payment and subscription processing is entirely FAKE and SIMULATED. No real money is ever involved, asked for, or charged. Any payment forms are just part of the demonstration.
-   The video content used in the demo (like Big Buck Bunny) is typically from open, Creative Commons sources, or publicly available samples, used here for illustrative purposes.
-   The User Interface (UI) of the application itself is designed to look somewhat modern and user-friendly. However, this README file you are reading now was written to be "not modern" and "not UI friendly" as per a specific request, so this README might be a bit dense, hard to read, or poorly organized. That's an intentional part of this specific exercise. The app itself should generally be easier to use than this README is to read.
-   Because it's a demo, the app might have bugs, unfinished features, or behave unexpectedly in some situations.
